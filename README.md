## Objectives

* Determine key statistical data about the month of July. 
* Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
* Compare your findings between the month of Jult and December.
* Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
* Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook. 

## Question
Are there certain times of the year when business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?

## Observations

The average temprerature in Oahu for June is 75F and December is 71F. During both months the temperature is about the same, plus is the peak time of tourist in Hawaii. 
For further analysis we recommend the following:

* Consider the 'no peak' time of visitors and understand their behavior and consumption. 
* Understand the possible behavior of customers by the location of the store. It could be next to the next or crossing the street. How the location can affect the number of visitors?
